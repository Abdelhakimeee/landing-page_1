## 🎯 Client Problem

The client experiences several challenges after running advertising campaigns:

- Frequent and repetitive questions from potential customers  
- Loss of time in answering basic inquiries  
- Difficulty identifying serious or qualified leads  
- Customers often miss important information such as:  
  ✔ Fabric type  
  ✔ Available colors  
  ✔ Styles / folds  
  ✔ Product video  

This leads to inefficiency and reduces the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
